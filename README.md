Welcome to redeem-with-python, a curated collection of 50 Python projects crafted during my rise as a Python programmer and AI enthusiast. From CLI tools and automation scripts to GUIs, APIs, and AI-powered applications, this repo reflects my philosophy: build, break, learn, repeat. Each project is a step forward in exploring the vast capabilities of Python — in web dev, data science, machine learning, cybersecurity, and more. This is not just a repository, it’s a roadmap of redemption, a tribute to hard work, and a future built with code.
